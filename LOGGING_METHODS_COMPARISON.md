### **Method 3: Debug Messages to LINE** ⭐⭐⭐

**Best for:** Quick debugging specific issues

**Pros:**
- ✅ See logs directly in LINE chat
- ✅ No need to switch windows
- ✅ Good for testing specific flows

**Cons:**
- ❌ Clutters the chat
- ❌ Only for development
- ❌ Must remove before production

**Implementation:**

Add to your `.env` or Render environment variables:
```
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

Add this helper method to `ReservationFlow` class:
```python
def _debug_log(self, user_id: str, message: str) -> str:
    """Send debug info to LINE if DEBUG_MODE is enabled"""
    if os.getenv("DEBUG_MODE", "false").lower() == "true":
        return f"🔍 DEBUG: {message}\n\n"
    return ""
```

Use it in your code:
```python
def _handle_time_modification(self, user_id: str, message: str) -> str:
    # Your existing code...
    
    debug_info = self._debug_log(user_id, f"Available slots: {len(available_slots)}")
    
    return debug_info + f"""時間変更ですね！
    
📅 利用可能な時間：
{time_options}"""
```

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Useful but temporary)

### **Method 4: External Logging Service** ⭐⭐

**Best for:** Large-scale production apps

**Pros:**
- ✅ Advanced features (alerts, analytics)
- ✅ Log retention
- ✅ Multi-service logging

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires setup
- ❌ May cost money
- ❌ Overkill for small projects

**Options:**
- **Logtail**: https://logtail.com/ (Free tier: 1GB/month)
- **Sentry**: https://sentry.io/ (Error tracking)
- **Datadog**: https://www.datadoghq.com/ (Enterprise)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐ (Not needed for your use case)

## 🚀 **Recommended Setup for Your Project**

### **For Development & Testing:**

1. **Use Render Dashboard** (Primary)
   - Open: https://dashboard.render.com/ → salonLineBot → Logs

   ```python
   logging.info(f"[Modification] Date: {date_str}, Total events: {len(events)}")
   logging.info(f"Detected 'reservation' intent for message: '{message_normalized}'")
   ```

3. **Optional: Add Debug Mode** (For quick tests)
   - Set `DEBUG_MODE=true` in Render environment
   - See logs directly in LINE chat

### **For Production:**

1. **Use Render Dashboard** for monitoring
2. **Keep `logging.info()` for key events**
